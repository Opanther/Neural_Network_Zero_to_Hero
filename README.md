# Neural_Network_Zero_to_Hero
This repo contains my code and exercises from the Deep Learning from Scratch YouTube series by Andrej Karpathy. It includes implementations of deep learning algorithms, hands-on examples with Python, NumPy, and Pytorch, and personal notes on neural networks, backpropagation, and optimization.
