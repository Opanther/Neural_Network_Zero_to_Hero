Deep Learning from Scratch - Code and Practice
This repository contains my code, exercises, and projects as I follow along with the Deep Learning from Scratch YouTube series by Andrej Karpathy.

Overview
This series covers fundamental concepts in deep learning and neural networks, with step-by-step coding tutorials. The repository includes:

Implementations of deep learning algorithms.
Hands-on coding examples using Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow.
Personal notes, projects, and challenges from each video.
